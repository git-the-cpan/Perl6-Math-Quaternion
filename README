Distribution Perl6-Math-Quaternion
Module       Math::Quaternion
Class        Math::Quaternion

This distribution implements an OO class for Quaternions, which are the
simplest of the hyper-complex numbers. It adds the operators needed for basic
math on the Qs, and should be a good base class for future modules to support
the other hyper-complex numbers.

RECOMMENDATIONS
    I intend this module to be a high-quality example of Perl 6 numeric OO,
    usable as a reference for future module authors.

WARNINGS
    This module is a mostly-from-scratch re-implementation of Quaternions;
    its API differs from the excellent Perl 5 Math::Quaternion module.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Thanks to:
        * Jonathan Chin for the original Perl 5 Math::Quaternion.
        * Solomon "colomon" Foster for encouraging this module's release.
        * Will "Coke" Coleda for fixes to match changes in Rakudo and in the
          Perl 6 specs.
        * RosettaCode for the challenge that provoked the initial code:
